# Role-Based Access Control Rails App
This is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system implemented in a Ruby on Rails application. The system allows assigning roles to users and controlling access to resources based on these roles. Users can have multiple roles, and access to resources is determined strictly by the assigned roles.
